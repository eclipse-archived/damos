The Damos project provides a development environment for designing systems using a dataflow-oriented approach. Such systems can be (but are not limited to) software systems, hardware systems (e.g. mechanical systems), or physical systems (e.g. system environment)&mdash;or a combination of those. Even though dataflow-oriented design is not bound to a specific domain, it is most commonly used in control systems engineering and digital signal processing (DSP). This project includes all necessary tools such as graphical and textual model editors, a simulation environment, and code generators.
