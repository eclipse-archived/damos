This project provides a development environment for analyzing and designing systems using a dataflow-oriented approach. Such systems are specified using block diagrams, which contain the software components (e.g. control algorithm) of the target device and the mechanical components as well as the physical environment to facilitate close-to-real-world system simulation. The mechanical and physical components of the system can be represented as a dynamical system, which is specified by providing the transfer function of the corresponding linear time-invariant (LTI) system. Even though data flow-oriented design is not bound to a specific domain, it is most commonly used in control systems engineering and digital signal processing. This project includes all necessary tools such as graphical and textual model editors, a simulation environment, and code generators.
